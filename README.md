# the-house
You enter an abandoned house with your friend Bobby Jones, who is only trying to help you be a little more brave. Your choices influence the outcome of the story.

### Project Purpose
A short twine game adapted from my short story "The House." This was a way to familiarize myself with Twine, primarily to use in the future to use as a branching narrative prototyping tool.
